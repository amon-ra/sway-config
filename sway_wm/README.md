# Sway WM configurations

To install this configurations in your system copy the **ontent** of the folder
"sway_wm" into your home's .config/sway folder, then reload your sway
configuration (usually Mod+Shift+C)

**REMEMBER**

If you have previous configurations this will overwrite them or collide with
some of your shortcut definitions, make sure to backup your configurations first!

# Requirements

This configurations use the following software/fonts/things:

* Terminator (terminal emulator)
* rofi (software launcher, similar to dmenu)
* i3lock (for an alternative configuration of the lockscreen)
* Terminus (TTF) font
